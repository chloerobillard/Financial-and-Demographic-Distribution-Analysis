# Financial-and-Demographic-Distribution-Analysis

This analysis is a case study for interpreting and making inferences from the financial data of a business. Through several different varieties of data distributions, I observe, analyze, and produce actionable inferences for a business and their customers to effectively improve profits and tailor to their customer base through precise demographics.

**Dataset Design and Details:**

The attached dataset is a hypothetical furniture store's gathered data which includes two months of customers and their generated sales for the business. The company has gathered metrics including customer IDs, ages, discounts, and December's and January's spending amounts per customer.

The key question for the attached dataset is the following: Does a discount positively impact the spending habits of customers by generating more sales?

The store wanted to improve their sales after their amount gained in December; consequently, they implemented a discount which would be given to every returning customer in January that was between 0-60% in increments of 5%. The spending results from January have the implemented discount rates. We will use the dataset and the subsequent data visualizations I have created to analyze the dataset and determine whether the furniture store's discounts helped increase their sales.

I use the following libraries to create and implement these figures: pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, numpy, sklearn.linear_model, and statsmodels.api.
